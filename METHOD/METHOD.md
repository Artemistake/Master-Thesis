## Research Question: 

**How are capitalist biases and principles applied to game mechanics in video games, and how does this affect the way we play?**

- Since its creation, the video game industry has been directly linked to the principles of profitability, expansion and productivity. I have sometimes observed that this situation, as well as the influence of the society in which we live, means that video games are sometimes imbued with these characteristics in their very mechanics. With this thesis I want to find out to what extent video games can be tainted by this kind of bias, and to identify it so that we can think about gameplay differently.


**To achieve this, I need to get precise informations, facts and feedbacks so that I can reflect on the medium. I think about getting this data on multiple sources:**
